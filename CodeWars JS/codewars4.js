Given a month as an integer from 1 to 12, return to which quarter of the year it belongs as an integer number.

For example: month 2 (February), is part of the first quarter; month 6 (June), is part of the second quarter; and month 11 (November), is part of the fourth quarter.

const quarterOf = (month) => {
  if (month <= 3) {
    return 1
  } else if (month <= 6) {
    return 2
  } else if (month <= 9) {
    return 3
  } else if (month <= 12) {
    return 4
  }
