//Keep Hydrated


// Nathan loves cycling.
//
// Because Nathan knows it is important to stay hydrated, he drinks 0.5 litres of water per hour of cycling.
//
// You get given the time in hours and you need to return the number of litres Nathan will drink, rounded to the smallest value.
//
// Solution:

function litres(time) {

  return Math.floor(time/2);
}
